*DESCRIPTION*

This Python script creates an interactive dashboard using Dash and Plotly to analyze mobile phone sales data from a CSV file named mobile_phones_2000.csv. The dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of mobile phone trends through three primary visual components: overall price distribution, brand performance, and feature relationships. Users can interact with the dashboard via dropdown filters for phone brands and price categories—Budget, Mid-range, and Premium—making the data exploration dynamic and insightful.

The script begins by categorizing phone prices into the defined ranges using a helper function. It then defines a Dash layout that includes headings, interactive graphs, and dropdown filters. The application uses callback functions to update visualizations based on user-selected inputs. For example, it filters data by the selected price category to update a histogram of phone prices, plots a scatter chart of average ratings versus prices for different models of a selected brand, and displays relationships between screen size and price, color-coded by RAM size.

This dashboard is useful for stakeholders looking to understand pricing strategies, brand positioning, and how features like screen size and RAM affect pricing across various segments. It runs locally on port 8051 with debugging enabled for development purposes.
